* In my freetime, I love to read about new technologies in the industry
* One of my new interests is Machine learning, this is fairly new to me and I have always wanted to learn more about machine learning
* Another interest I have is learning about management techniques and new ways of managing a team, as this is what I want to do in the future.
## Technical Background
	I have held various positions in the IT field. My first job was a desktop support student technician at Grand Valley where I worked on setting up instructor stations, re-imaging computers, and setting up printers. I then got my first internship at Meijer as a software developer. 
	In this internship I developed a web application in C# about retrieving all on-prem applications. My second internship was with Stellantis. In this internship I did some linux administration and product evaluation of a new software that was going to be later implemented onto linux computers. </br>
